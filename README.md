# Scale Sense

Scale Sense is a web-based learning tool that utilizes machine learning (ml5.js library) to listen to, analyze, and grade musical pitches in real-time. This tool is designed to be an invaluable resource for all music lovers: from students practicing for auditions and competitions, to individuals new to learning music. By harnessing the capabilities of CREPE (Convolutional Representation for Pitch Estimation), our tool can assess pitch accuracy across a wide range of musical scales, including major, minor, harmonic, and melodic scales, offering students and musicians a comprehensive and immediate feedback mechanism for improving their musical skills.
